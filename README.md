# Rei-Engine 1.0

### Running the program
All you need to do is run the `ReiEngine-3.2` executable in the `bin` 
directory and have fun :D.

#### Scripting
By default, the script folder must be located within the same directory 
as the executable, with the directory structure as shown in the default 
`script` folder. The `EntityTypes` `INIT_SC` and `TextureLoad` scripts 
are mandatory for the engine to load entities, scenes and textures 
respectively. Behaviour scripts for each entity can then be added or 
removed freely within the `Behaviour` folder.

**Building:**See the [master](ReiEngineCpp/master)
